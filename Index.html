            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="src/selfie.jpg" alt="Professional headshot of [Your Name]" class="profile-photo">
            <p>Hey, I'm XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, a current student and future software developer. I am from XXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXX, and I am passionate about building solutions that can make a positive impact. My journey has not been linear, but it has shaped me into a resilient, adaptable, and creative problem-solver. As someone who has faced significant challenges in life, I take pride in my ability to find innovative ways to overcome obstacles and push forward.</p>
            <p>I’m a mental health advocate, and I believe that raising awareness and breaking the stigma surrounding mental health is essential for creating a compassionate and understanding society. I've spent a lot of my time working on self-growth and helping others navigate their own struggles, which has only deepened my commitment to this cause.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy engaging in various activities that help me expand my knowledge and skills. Whether it's reading insightful books, writing thought-provoking essays, or diving deep into new topics, I am always learning. I also have a passion for music theory, piano, and singing, which not only serves as a creative outlet but also helps me relax and recharge.</p>
            <p>With my background in tech and my drive to make a meaningful difference in the world, I am continuously working towards becoming a better version of myself. I aim to leverage my skills in software development to create tools and solutions that empower individuals and communities, particularly in the mental health space.</p>
